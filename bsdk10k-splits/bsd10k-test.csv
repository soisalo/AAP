The author has given me permission to keep and share her laughter as long as I don't release her identity. Recorded with the incredible Josephson C720 microphone through NPNG preamp and Empirical Labs compression. Tracked to Pro Tools with final edits performed in Cool Edit Pro. At some points my voice may be heard through the talkback and there are some movement noises and paper shuffling etc. There is also the occasional spoken word. I'm not sure why some of these samples are clipped to snot; probably a Pro Tools gremlin. Still, it doesn't sound too bad."

Also known as ""Solari Boards"" (most were made in Italy by Solari di Udine), the signs' familiar ""clack clack clack"" rhythm is sufficient to trigger an almost Pavlovian reflex in seasoned travelers the world over. This 34 second sample was captured on September 20, 2006 in the main waiting room of Amtrak's Philadelphia, PA (USA) 30th Street rail station as the train status board was being updated. The recording contains considerable ambient room and rush-hour crowd noisein the stereo mix. Equipment used was a pair of MKH-800 microphones in a mid-side arrangement (hyper-cardioid and figure-8) and a Sound Devices 744T digital recorder. This sample consists of the unprocessed (not stereo decoded) mid-side audio (mid mic on the leftchannel and side mic on the right channel). A conventional stereo-decoded mix version of this recording can be found in the mab-bigboard sample pack."

Also known as ""Solari Boards"" (most were made in Italy by Solari di Udine), the signs' familiar ""clack clack clack"" rhythm is sufficient to trigger an almost Pavlovian reflex in seasoned travelers the world over. This 34 second sample was captured on September 20, 2006 in the main waiting room of Amtrak's Philadelphia, PA (USA) 30th Street rail station as the train status board was being updated. Equipment used was a pair of MKH-800 microphones in a mid-side arrangement (hyper-cardioid and figure-8) and a Sound Devices 744T digital recorder. This recording has been mixed down to monaural and heavily low-cut processed to reduce ambient noise, and can be mixed as a sound effect over an existing dialog or ambient track. A non-EQed stereo mix can be found in the mab-bigboard sample pack."

I recorded it about half past six, so a little close to the twilight, and i suppose it has something to say also, but it wasn't near dark when the recording was done. Although there's not mush wildlife this time, i can still hear something moving around every now and then, when i listen closely. And the deep almost silent roar from the sea can easily be heard this time, even though there's about 2,5 km to the north sea shore.

Then I ad the last one at the end of the first one, mix a little bit to make the two sounds seemed natural together.After, I normalized the track. At the end, I saved and export my track !"

The rain stick is considered to have been invented in Peru or Chile as a talisman to encourage rainfall however its use as an instrument is now widespread on the African continent as well. These two rainsticks were recorded by taping a Josephson C42 microphone to each end of the instrument's body. At the same time a Josephson C617 omni was placed about a foot away to fill out the center image, the idea being to create a very wide and close stereo image which is still fully mono-compatible. All preamps were NPNG with no additional processing. All sources were recorded into Pro Tools via Frontier Design Group converters and final edits were performed in Cool Edit Pro.

It is tuned to C sharp, but I have dropped the fourth note (F sharp) out of the scale. There are four packs with lots of recordings in them, strums, plucks, short improvisations. ""Short melodic statements"" are 1-2 bars. ""Riffs"" are 2-4 bars. ""Melodies"" are about 30 seconds and ""Runs and Flutters"" speaks for itself. There is recording of tuning up the Swarmandal in the melodies pack. The snippets were taken from recordings done on three different days so you may notice a slight difference in volume and background noise. A couple of the recordings have some ambient noise (bird tweets, wind chimes,) Some of the melodies are based around a similar theme but have enough variation to be interesting/useful. Credit is not required but always appreciated. Linking to the sound allows others to find this amazing website. :-) I love to hear what you have used my sounds for!"

Le chêne forme souvent des forêts mixtes en association avec d'autres feuillus. Les chênes sont des arbres à bois dur. Le bois de chêne a une masse volumique entre 0,75 et 0,85g/cm³. C'est un matériau très résistant et très dur. Sa résistance aux insectes et aux champignons (durabilité naturelle) est très importante grâce à sa forte teneur en tanin. Les grandes planches radiales de chêne sont prisées depuis le Moyen-Âge et servent à réaliser des boiseries d'intérieur de bâtiment prestigieux comme la Chambre des communes en Angleterre à Londres, et dans la construction de menuiserie fine. Le bois de chêne, du chêne pédonculé et du chêne rouvre était utilisé en Europe pour la construction navale jusqu'au XIXe siècle et les principales essences de bois utilisées dans la construction des charpentes en bois des bâtiments en Europe. Aujourd'hui le bois de chêne reste couramment utilisé dans la menuiserie, la parquèterie, et la production de plaquage. Les tonneaux dans lesquels les vins rouges, xérès et d'autres spiritueux tel que le scotch whisky et le bourbon sont vieillis, sont des fûts de chênes. Les tonneaux de chêne contribuent à la saveurs vanillée de ces boissons. Les copeaux de bois de chênes sont utilisés pour le fumage du poisson, de la viande, du fromage et d'autres produits alimentaires."

Meanwhile, mechanical and electrical noises are almost imperceptible. From time to time, the wheels crushing on a curve, or the rock of the wagons as they pass over a junction of tracks. You could perfectly notice when the train enters the tunnel: low frequencies become amplified and they eat all of the soundscape with an intensity that sometimes hurts your ears. When the train exits the tunnel, everything become as it was. The air conditioning machine keeps to work, buzzing all around. People, used to all of this, keep on talking about their things. Suddenly a mechanical voice, tell us about the next stop. Train stops, and the mechanical noises disappear. Doors are opened, and people get inside and outside the wagon.

They really do seem fond of and are quite common around towns and cities. PLUS, another amazing fact that I read on the Cornell Ornithology website is that these birds do NOT build a nest, rather the female simply lays her eggs directly on the ground, and lets camouflage do the rest!
