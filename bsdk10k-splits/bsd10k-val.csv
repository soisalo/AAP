This recording contains more hiss than many of my existing nature recordings, BUT I still want to post it so you can get sample of this wonderful signature sound of summer woods at dusk. Recording made in the Shawnee National Forest in late May of 2010 using my Zoom H4N recorder. I used an Audio Technica AT8035. I was trying out this microphone. This particular microphone does have a narrow acceptance angle, which is probably 1 reason for the hissiness. Still, go out in the summer woods around dusk sometime and maybe you will get lucky and hear this beautiful little bird whose distinctive calls have livened up the woods for generations of many youngsters – including me!"

Naming conventions for note samples is as follows: BsGr([fret position]f,[string number]s[MIDI note number])~v[velocity number 1-5] Fret positions with the designation [N#] indicate ""negative fret"", which are samples of the low E string detuned down in relation to their open standard-tuned (unfretted) note.
